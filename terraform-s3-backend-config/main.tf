# Limitations with Terraforms Backends
# To make this work, you had to use a two-step process:

# 1. Write Terraform code to create the S3 bucket and
# DynamoDB table, and deploy that code with a local
# backend.

# 2. Go back to the Terraform code, add a remote backend
# configuration to it to use the newly created S3 bucket
# and DynamoDB table, and run terraform init to copy
# your local state to S3.

# If you ever wanted to delete the S3 bucket and DynamoDB
# table, youâ€™d have to do this two-step process in reverse:

# 1. Go to the Terraform code, remove the backend
# configuration, and rerun terraform init to copy the
# Terraform state back to your local disk.

# 2. Run terraform destroy to delete the S3 bucket and
# DynamoDB table.
